Computer scientist. 8+ years experience in the tech industry working on production-level software. 

In recent years I've specialized in computational aspects of bayesian inference. BlackJax contributor (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10797 and https://github.com/users/ciguaran/projects/1). 

I am interested in software engineering for scientific computing, the modelling of statistical problems as programs and the implementation of inference algorithms such as MCMC and SMC.
